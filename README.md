# Dates-and-Time-in-Python
This repository explores ways of working with times and dates in Python. It explores the datetime module that comes with the standard Python library. We also look at dateparser, a third party Python package.

## Installations
You need a version of Python3.7 or above. I had Python 3.6 installed and the .fromisoformat did not work. This is because I needed a later version of Python. All Python installations come with pip, a package manager, which will discussed further in this document.
On Ubuntu/Linux, to uninstall outdated versions of Python:
```
 - sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/python2.x as well as python3.x
 - sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.x as well as python3.x
 - sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.x as well as python 3.x 
 ```

updating Ubuntu:
`` -sudo apt-get update``
Now download a python tgz file from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and unzip it and CD into it
```
./configure
make test
sudo make install
```
Python should be installed now. Check by running python
